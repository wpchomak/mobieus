# Project EchoCopy
Project EchoCopy was developed to streamline the process of transferring vast amounts of data within Azure File Shares. This project specifically targets scenarios involving the copying of hundreds of terabytes, encompassing millions of files across thousands of directories. While Azure Data Box is typically the go-to solution for such extensive data transfer tasks, Project EchoCopy is designed for situations where Azure Data Box is not a viable option.
