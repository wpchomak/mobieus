1. To ensure optimal performance, execute the scripts from an Azure Windows Virtual Machine (VM) that is located in the same region as either the Source or the Destination Storage Account.
2. Establish logical drive mappings for both the Source and the Destination storage locations.
3. Set up a directory for log files. By default, the script uses d:\echoCopy, but you can modify this location as necessary.
4. Execute createRobocopyJobs.ps1. This will open Windows Explorer to facilitate easy navigation to the Source and Destination. If the Explorer window appears in the background, use Alt-Tab to bring it to the forefront. Upon completion, a text file containing all Robocopy job commands will be created. However, this file requires manual editing (fix in progress). Modify the beginning of each command from 'start robocopy ' to '{robocopy ', and change the end from 'log"' to 'log"},'. Note that the final command in the file should not have a comma at the end. Additionally, a 'Logs' subdirectory will be created containing a folder for each job, where the corresponding log files for error checking and troubleshooting will be stored.
5. Copy all the job commands from the generated text file to your clipboard.
6. Open runRoboCopyJobs.ps1, paste the copied job commands over lines 3-6, set $maxConcurrentJobs and run the script.
7. /mir /MT:64 /zb /is /v /np   These are the switches to ensure existing files copied over.
